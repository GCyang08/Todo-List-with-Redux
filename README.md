# Todo_List_with_Redux

To view my code, PLEASE download the ZIP file from the master branch.


I got this to-do list challenge from Front End Mentor. 
To create this app I've used React to write all logic necessary to complete this project. 
I've used Redux as well to store my state and to dispatch all action to bring this web app to life. 
For this app, the user should be able to view optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size, 
see hover states for all interactive elements on the page, add new to-dos to the list, mark to-dos as complete, 
delete to-dos from list, filter by all/active/complete to-dos, clear all completed to-dos, and toggle light and dark mode.
